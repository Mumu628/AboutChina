                <h1>Chinese People's Payment Methods</h1>
                <p>Nowadays, Chinese people have a variety of payment methods, mainly including the followings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mobile Payment<br />
                        It is currently the most mainstream payment method. Represented by Alipay and WeChat Pay, users
                        only need to install apps on their mobile phones and bind bank cards to pay by scanning QR
                        codes, presenting payment codes, etc. Mobile payment covers diverse online and offline scenarios
                        such as shopping, catering, and transportation. According to data from the People's Bank of
                        China, the penetration rate of mobile payment in China reaches 86%, ranking first in the world.
                        In addition, mobile payment has derived biometric payment methods such as face-swiping and
                        fingerprint payment, further improving payment convenience and security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bank Card Payment<br />
                        Bank cards are divided into debit and credit cards. Debit cards are directly linked to users'
                        bank accounts, and funds are deducted directly from the account when consuming; credit cards
                        allow users to overdraw within a certain limit and repay within the specified repayment period.
                        Bank card payments are usually operated through POS machines, widely used in commercial places
                        such as shopping malls, supermarkets and restaurants. Although mobile payment dominates, bank
                        card payment is still indispensable in some large-value transactions or scenarios requiring
                        identity verification.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cash Payment<br />
                        As the most traditional payment method, the proportion of cash payment has decreased, but it
                        still holds an irreplaceable position. It is still widely used in some small retail stores,
                        markets, remote areas and among the elderly who are not familiar with electronic payments. Cash
                        payment has the characteristics of immediacy and anonymity, allowing both parties to complete
                        the transaction immediately without relying on electronic devices or the Internet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other Payment Methods<br />
                        Such as NFC payment, where users can complete payment by bringing NFC-enabled devices close to
                        the payment terminal, which is convenient for public transportation and other scenarios. There
                        is also mini-program payment, which is made through mini-programs on platforms such as WeChat
                        and Alipay, featuring "use-and-go" to enhance user experience. In addition, contactless payment
                        is mainly used in scenarios such as parking lots and highway toll gates, where vehicles
                        automatically deduct fees when passing, eliminating the need to stop and wait for payment.
                    </li>

                <h1>Eating Habits in Different Regions</h1>
                <p>China has a vast territory with significant differences in food flavors. The Eight Great Cuisines
                    (Shandong, Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan and Anhui) are the essence of our
                    food culture. Below is an introduction to provinces grouped by similar characteristics:</p>

                <p>The Qinghai-Tibet region (mainly Tibet Autonomous Region and southern Qinghai Province) has a
                    high-altitude and low-temperature geographical climate. The diet is centered on storable and
                    high-calorie ingredients, with a salty, slightly spicy and fragrant taste, combining nomadic and
                    agricultural dietary characteristics.</p>

                <p><strong>Cultural characteristics:</strong> Influenced by religious culture, there are dietary taboos
                    in some areas (e.g. some Tibetans do not eat fish). The diet focuses on practicality and warmth,

            <div id="travel_ways" class="living-intro">
                <h1>Chinese People's Travel Ways</h1>
                <p>China's travel methods have formed a diversified system covering short, medium and long distances,
                    mainly including railway, road (including self-driving and passenger transport), civil aviation,
                    waterway and urban public transportation. Precautions for different methods need to be prepared in
                    advance according to their characteristics.</p>
                <h2>(1) Railway Travel (including high-speed rail(HSR) and conventional trains)</h2>
                <p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong> Wide coverage, high cost performance for medium and
                    long-distance travel. The on-time rate of HSR exceeds 99%, and conventional trains have lower fares.
                    Suitable for distances of 100-2000 kilometers, such as inter-provincial commuting and travel, and
                    can directly reach most prefecture-level cities and key counties.</p>
                <p><strong>Precautions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ticketing and Documents:</strong> Purchase tickets through the official 12306 platform
                        (https://www.12306.cn/index/). Passengers must carry original ID cards (or electronic ID cards,
                        household registration books and other valid documents) when traveling. Children with a height
                        of 1.2-1.5 meters need to buy children's tickets, and those under 1.2 meters are free of charge.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Check-in for HSR closes 5 minutes before departure, and for
                        conventional trains usually 10-15 minutes in advance. It is recommended to arrive at the station
                        30 minutes early to avoid delays due to security checks and finding platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Luggage Norms:</strong> Each person can carry luggage for free with a weight not
                        exceeding 20 kilograms (HSR) and 25 kilograms (conventional trains), and the total length, width
                        and height not exceeding 130 centimeters. Carrying flammable and explosive items (such as
                        alcohol, more than 2 lighters) is prohibited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Travel Etiquette:</strong> There are 5 seats in a row in the second-class seat of HSR;
                        avoid occupying the armrest of the adjacent seat. Travel quietly, lower the volume when
                        answering calls, and avoid noise after 22:00 at night.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Road Travel (including self-driving, intercity buses, taxis/ride-hailing cars)</h2>
                <h3>Self-driving Travel</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong> High flexibility, allowing route adjustments at any time.
                    Suitable for short-distance travel, family trips or remote areas (without railway/civil aviation
                    coverage). The national expressway network has realized "every county is connected by expressways".
                </p>
                <p><strong>Precautions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle Inspection:</strong> Before departure, check tires (tire pressure, wear),
                        brakes, fuel volume and antifreeze. For long distances, it is recommended to carry a spare tire,
                        jack and emergency power supply.</li>
                    <li><strong>Route Planning:</strong> Use navigation software (such as Amap, Baidu Maps) to plan
                        routes in advance and avoid construction sections. Pay attention to speed limits on expressways
                        (usually 100-120 kilometers per hour), and rest for more than 20 minutes after continuous
                        driving for 4 hours (to avoid fatigue driving).</li>
                    <li><strong>Fees and Rules:</strong> Expressway fees are charged by mileage (about 0.4-0.6 yuan per
                        kilometer). Small cars with 7 seats or less are free of charge during legal holidays (Spring
                        Festival, National Day, etc.). Abide by traffic rules, do not occupy emergency lanes, and slow
                        down and change lanes in advance before expressway exits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Handling:</strong> In case of vehicle breakdown, move the vehicle to the
                        emergency lane, turn on double flashers, place a triangular warning sign (more than 150 meters
                        away from the vehicle on expressways), and call the 12122 expressway rescue number.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Intercity Buses (including urban-rural shuttles)</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong> Connect cities with villages and small and medium-sized towns.
                    The fare is lower than that of HSR, suitable for medium and short-distance travel in areas without
                    railway coverage (usually 100-500 kilometers).</p>
                <p><strong>Precautions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ticketing Channels:</strong> Purchase tickets through station ticket windows or official
                        apps (such as "Ctrip Bus Tickets", "Bus Steward"). Avoid buying tickets from roadside "illegal
                        taxis" to prevent fraud.</li>
                    <li><strong>Travel Safety:</strong> Fasten seat belts throughout the journey and do not walk around
                        randomly when the bus is moving. Carrying pets (except guide dogs) and oversized luggage
                        (usually limited to 10 kilograms and volume not exceeding 0.02 cubic meters) is prohibited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirmation Before Alighting:</strong> Pack luggage in advance before arriving at the
                        station, and check under the seat and luggage rack when getting off to avoid missing items.
                        Urban-rural shuttles may stop at any time; inform the driver of the alighting location in
                        advance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong> Provide "door-to-door" service, suitable for short-distance
                    travel in cities (usually 5-20 kilometers) or transfer between airports/stations. Ride-hailing cars
                    can be booked in advance through apps with transparent prices.</p>
                <p><strong>Precautions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular Travel:</strong> Choose taxis with complete roof lights and taximeters, and
                        avoid taking "illegal taxis" without signs. For ride-hailing cars, confirm that the license
                        plate and model are consistent with those displayed on the app, and share the trip with
                        relatives and friends after boarding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fee Confirmation:</strong> Request taxis to use meters for billing and ask for invoices
                        before getting off (for rights protection). For ride-hailing cars, pay attention to the usage
                        rules of platform coupons to avoid excessive price surges during peak hours (morning and evening
                        rush hours, holidays).</li>
                    <li><strong>Luggage Storage:</strong> Check personal items such as mobile phones and backpacks
                        before getting off, especially in the back seat and door storage compartments. If items are
                        lost, contact the transportation management department (such as the local taxi company) for
                        taxis, and contact the driver through the app for ride-hailing cars.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Ticketing and Documents:</strong> Purchase tickets through airline official websites or
                        OTA platforms (such as Ctrip, Fliggy), and fill in accurate names and ID numbers (passports are
                        required for international flights). Children (2-12 years old) need to buy children's tickets,

                        seasons), and register vehicle information (passengers traveling with self-driving vehicles need
                        to be bound with vehicle tickets).</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Norms:</strong> Follow the instructions of the staff after boarding to find the

                        to the seat and fasten the seat belt (some cruise ships are equipped with seat belts).</li>
                    <li><strong>Luggage Storage:</strong> For vehicle ferries, lock the car doors and carry valuables
                        with you instead of leaving them in the car. For cruise ship travel, avoid placing personal
                        items near windows to prevent them from falling due to wind and waves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Tips:</strong> Motion sickness sufferers need to take motion sickness medicine
                        (such as Chengyunning) in advance, choose seats in the middle and front of the ship (with less
                        jolting), and properly ventilate and look far away during navigation to relieve discomfort.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Urban Public Transportation (including buses, subways, shared bikes)</h2>

                        to avoid long waits. Swipe a bus card or scan a code (such as Alipay "bus code") when boarding,
                        get on at the front door and get off at the back door. Elderly passengers and pregnant women
                        need to stand firm and hold on tight to avoid falling due to sudden braking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subway Travel:</strong> Security checks are required when entering the station; carrying
                        flammable, explosive and controlled knives is prohibited. Queue up for the train according to

                <h1>Chinese People's Living Customs</h1>
                <p>China has a vast territory, and the customs and cultures in different regions are influenced by
                    factors such as history, geography and ethnicity, showing distinct diversity. It is impossible to
                    exhaust all details in a short space. Below, we will refine the most representative living customs,
                    preferences and taboos of each region according to seven major regions-Northeast China, North China,
                    East China, Central China, South China, Southwest China and Northwest China-to provide you with an
                    overview reference.</p>
                <h2>(1) Northeast China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, eastern Inner Mongolia)</h2>
                <h3>1. Living Customs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The winter is cold and long, forming the tradition of "staying indoors during winter". Outdoor
                        activities in winter are mainly ice and snow projects, such as skiing, ice lantern garden
                        parties, and ice top spinning.</li>
                    <li>Prefer "big pot dishes" in diet, emphasizing large portions and strong tastes. Stewed dishes are
                        the core, such as stewed chicken with mushrooms, braised pork with vermicelli, and iron pot
                        stewed goose.</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to "hospitality" in social interactions. When receiving guests, they will take the
                        initiative to add dishes and urge them to drink. They like to liven up the atmosphere with
                        humorous "chatting" during meals and attach importance to human relationships.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Preferences and Taboos:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prefer lively atmospheres. During festivals or family gatherings, they like group dinners and
                        collective entertainment, such as Yangko dancing and playing poker (such as "Fight the
                        Landlord", "Upgrade").</li>
                    <li>Taboo letting guests stay outdoors for a long time in winter, thinking that "freezing guests" is
                        impolite; taboo giving gifts with odd numbers, especially 1, 3 and other numbers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>(2) North China (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, western and central Inner Mongolia)</h2>
                <h3>1. Living Customs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As famous historical and cultural cities, Beijing and Tianjin retain many traditional folk
                        customs, such as Beijing's hutong culture, Tianjin's cross-talk and clapper talk. Daily
                        communication has distinct dialect characteristics (such as the "erhua" sound in Beijing dialect
                        and the "funny sense" in Tianjin dialect).</li>
                    <li>In diet, Beijing prefers "Beijing-style snacks" (such as fried sauce noodles, soybean milk with
                        fried dough rings), Tianjin is famous for its "breakfast culture" (such as jianbing guozi,
                        Goubuli steamed buns), and Shanxi is "inseparable from noodles"—knife-cut noodles, ticked
                        noodles and torn noodles are daily staples.</li>
                    <li>Some areas in Hebei and Shanxi retain traditional festival customs, such as pasting Spring
                        Festival couplets and hanging lanterns during the Spring Festival, guessing lantern riddles and
                        celebrating with lanterns during the Lantern Festival. Southern Shanxi also holds "shehuo"
                        performances (such as dragon and lion dances, stilt walking).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Preferences and Taboos:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prefer "sincerity", and emphasize "speaking the truth" in dealing with people, not liking to
                        beat around the bush; taboo too light or too spicy tastes in diet, pursuing "moderate salty and
                        fragrant".</li>
                    <li>Tianjin people taboo adding non-traditional ingredients such as "lettuce and spicy strips" to
                        jianbing guozi, thinking it "destroys the authentic taste"; some areas in Shanxi taboo "knocking
                        bowls" while eating, thinking it is like beggars begging.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>(3) East China (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong)</h2>
                <h3>1. Living Customs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Jiangnan region (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai) emphasizes "exquisiteness" with a relatively
                        slow pace of life. The diet is mainly "light and fresh", and good at cooking river and seafood,
                        such as Suzhou's squirrel mandarin fish, Hangzhou's West Lake vinegar fish, and Shanghai's local
                        cuisine (braised pork in brown sauce, sizzling eel paste).</li>
                    <li>Influenced by marine culture, Fujian takes "seafood" as the core of its diet and has a tradition
                        of "drinking tea". Minnan's Kung Fu tea and Fuzhou's jasmine tea are daily necessities. It also
                        retains the custom of "worshipping gods and ancestors", and prepares offerings (such as zongzi,
                        mooncakes) to worship ancestors during festivals.</li>
                    <li>As the "hometown of Confucius and Mencius", Shandong attaches importance to "etiquette". The
                        table culture emphasizes "respect for elders and juniors"—elders take the first bite, and
                        juniors need to raise their glasses to toast elders. Prefer "Shandong Cuisine" in diet, such as
                        braised intestines in brown sauce and braised sea cucumber with scallions, with a salty and
                        fresh taste.</li>
                    <li>Anhui and Jiangxi have many mountains and hills, and their diets are "strong-tasting", good at
                        preserving ingredients by pickling and curing, such as Anhui's stinky mandarin fish and
                        Jiangxi's stir-fried pork with cured meat. They like to eat spicy food daily.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Jiangnan region taboos "waste". Although they pay attention to rich dishes when treating
                        guests, they do not advocate too many leftovers; the Minnan region of Fujian taboos the number
                        "4" (homophonic to "death"), and usually avoids this number in phone numbers and floor numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Shandong taboos "sticking chopsticks upright in rice" while eating, thinking it is like
                        sacrificing to the deceased; some areas in Jiangxi taboo "patting the stomach after meals",
                        thinking it is disrespectful to the host's cooking skills.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>(4) Central China (Henan, Hubei, Hunan)</h2>
                <h3>1. Living Customs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Henan is the core area of "Central Plains culture" and retains many traditional customs, such as
                        pasting "door gods" during the Spring Festival and hanging "mugwort" during the Dragon Boat
                        Festival. The diet is "both wheat-based and rice-based", and likes to eat salty soup (such as
                        spicy soup) and braised noodles, with a salty and fresh taste.</li>
                    <li>Influenced by "Yangtze River culture", Hubei takes "fish" as an important dietary element, such
                        as Wuhan's Wuchang fish and Jingzhou's fish cake. It also has the tradition of "having morning
                        meal (a Wuhan tradition)", and hot dry noodles, tofu skin and mianwo are classic breakfast
                        combinations.</li>
                    <li>Hunan people "can't live without spicy food". The diet is mainly "spicy and fragrant", such as

                        vegetables (such as chopped chili and sour cowpea) daily; pay attention to "straightforwardness"
                        in social interactions, and do things without delay.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wuhan, Hubei taboos "saying inauspicious words by the river", especially avoiding mentioning
                        words such as "drowning" and "shipwreck"; some areas in Hunan taboo "breaking bowls and dishes
                        during the Spring Festival", and if broken, they need to say "peace every year" to resolve it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Henan taboos "sweeping the floor and taking out garbage during the Spring Festival", thinking it
                        will "sweep away wealth"; in diet, Hubei taboos "eating hot dry noodles without sesame paste",
                        and Hunan taboos "eating only fish meat but not chopped chili when eating steamed fish head with

                <ul>
                    <li>Guangdong (including Hong Kong and Macao) has a rich food culture, emphasizing "fresh
                        ingredients". "Cantonese Cuisine" is characterized by "lightness and original flavor", such as
                        white-cut chicken and steamed fish. It also has the core custom of "having morning tea"—there
                        are various morning tea dim sums (shrimp dumplings, siu mai, barbecued pork buns), which is an
                        important social scene.</li>
                    <li>Guangxi is a multi-ethnic settlement (Zhuang, Han, Yao, etc.). The Zhuang people have the "March
                        3rd" Song Festival, where people sing, dance and eat five-color glutinous rice. The diet prefers
                        "sour and spicy", such as Liuzhou river snails rice noodles and Nanning old friend noodles, and

                        thinking that "turning over fish" implies "shipwreck"; Hong Kong and Macao taboo the number

                        Festival), thinking it is disrespectful; Hainan taboos "speaking swear words under coconut
                        trees", thinking it will offend the "coconut god".</li>

                <h3>1. Living Customs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sichuan and Chongqing's diet is centered on "numbing and spicy". Hot pot is an important carrier
                        of daily social interactions, such as Chongqing old hot pot and Sichuan clear oil hot pot. They
                        also like to eat "snacks", such as Chengdu's Dan Dan noodles and Chongqing's sour and spicy

                        mahjong" to relax.</li>
                    <li>Yunnan is a multi-ethnic settlement (Yi, Bai, Dai, etc.), with great differences in customs
                        among various ethnic groups. For example, the Dai people's Water Splashing Festival (mid-April,
                        splashing water to pray for blessings) and the Yi people's Torch Festival (24th of June,
                        lighting torches to drive away evil spirits). The diet prefers "sour, spicy and fresh", such as
                        cross-bridge rice noodles and steam pot chicken, and is good at using wild mushrooms and wild
                        vegetables in cooking.</li>

                        a tradition of "drinking alcohol". When receiving guests, it will use "door-blocking wine" (a
                        Miao custom) to welcome them; some areas retain "stilted building" architecture to adapt to
                        mountainous terrain.</li>
                    <li>Influenced by Tibetan culture, Tibet's daily diet is mainly "tsampa, butter tea and yak meat".
                        It respects "religious customs"—remove hats and do not take photos when entering temples, and
                        perform the "hada presentation" ceremony when meeting to express respect.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Preferences and Taboos:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sichuan and Chongqing taboo "rummaging through dishes while eating hot pot", thinking it is
                        "stirring up the river and sea" and impolite; the Dai people in Yunnan taboo "splashing cold
                        water during the Water Splashing Festival", thinking it will bring bad luck.</li>
                    <li>Tibet taboos "touching others' heads", thinking it is disrespectful; the Miao people in Guizhou
                        taboo "stepping on others' feet", thinking it will affect the relationship between both parties.
                    </li>

                        Qishan saozi noodles. It also has the tradition of "breaking steamed buns for paomo"—the steamed

                    <li>Gansu and Qinghai have many mountains and plateaus, and their diets are "bold and unrestrained".
                        They like to eat "beef and mutton", such as Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles and Qinghai's
                        hand-grabbed mutton, and have the habit of "drinking milk tea" (salty milk tea). They usually
                        use "big bowls" to hold rice to show hospitality.</li>
                    <li>Ningxia is a Hui settlement. The diet follows "Halal" customs, prohibiting pork and dog meat. It

                    <li>Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic settlement (Uygur, Han, Kazakh, etc.). The Uygur people have

                        (such as Mazhap). During festivals, they hold "Eid al-Adha" (sacrificing animals to pray for
                        blessings) and visit relatives and friends with gifts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Preferences and Taboos:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shaanxi taboos "stirring too hard with chopsticks when eating mutton paomo", thinking it will
                        destroy the aroma of the soup; the Uygur people in Xinjiang taboo "spitting or blowing nose in
                        front of others", thinking it is uncivilized behavior.</li>
